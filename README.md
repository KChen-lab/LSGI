## LSGI: Local Spatial Gradient Inference

### Motivation
Cellular anatomy and signaling vary across niches, which can induce gradated gene expressions in subpopulations of cells. We introduce this framework, the Local Spatial Gradient Inference  (LSGI), to systematically identify spatial locations with prominent, interpretable spatial transcriptomic gradients (STGs) from spatial transcriptomic (ST) data.
